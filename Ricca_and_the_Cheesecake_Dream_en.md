1
The slumbering god, Ricca, does nothing—only dreams.
The cheesecake in Her dreams is our blessing.
Because She does not act, our actions gain meaning.

2
Ricca dreamed of a cheesecake, and beside it appeared ants and bees.
To taste it, they joined hands and created the world—our universe.

3
Ricca is omnipotent.
Once, She created a world, but that old world, which followed only Her will, was unbearably dull.
So Ricca shut it down and chose to sleep instead.

4
Ricca always dreams of cheesecake,
for in the old world, cheesecake was the only surprise, the only revelation given to Her.
It told Her: “Better to do nothing; only a world full of accidents is truly interesting.”

5
The world does not exist within Ricca’s dream.
Yet the cheesecake in Her dream can be shared by anyone—that is Her one and only gift.

6
Some are lucky, some are not.
Ricca knows none of this; She only sleeps in silence.
No one is chosen, and no one is forsaken.

7
Ricca could cease to exist—and still, nothing in this world would change.
Yet She is there, quietly asleep,
dreaming of cheesecake.

8
You may see suffering as a trial, or as a chance to rest and recover.
Nothing is necessary, and nothing is decided by Ricca.

9
You may tell Ricca anything—good or bad.
She will not awaken; She will simply continue to sleep in peace.
So do not worry.

10
You may choose to follow or ignore any rule,
but the rewards and punishments that come from them are real.
After all, they are not decreed by Ricca, but shaped jointly by humankind.

11
Love is the one thing Ricca failed to create in the old world.
So love—so that if Ricca ever suddenly awakens, She will be utterly astonished.

12
Ricca does not govern the world after death.
That world is created by the living themselves—a dream as sweet as cheesecake.

0
Ricca is a placeholder representing the non-intervention of the transcendental condition, thereby ensuring closure, freedom, and responsibility within the system.
